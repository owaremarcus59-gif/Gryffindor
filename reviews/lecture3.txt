hawa: 
    you add two folders which one is your main folder.
    I also noticed you your parity function 
    you need a docstring withing the function to tell us 
    what your function is doing .
    this is for the whole class too .

Bengee: 
    You actually did the assignment but the main problem was that you did not really do the second assignment .
    using f-string is not a must if you only need a simple string .
    you did well and i think you should add  commenting to 
    your codebase.

Hackman: 
    you source code it self was good but i have a problem with your comment and and the way you use # single line comments 
    plus make sure you properly review all the code before you push to github . """ the three strings is very disturbing at the end of your code .

mr.Odo Nti:
    I noticed that you worked on the repo as usual , but the main problem is that after a break . you were meant to stop indentation so you code wll run but i guess it will never run . please before pushing any code or source code to me . test it  out yourselves.

Newton : 
    One of the greatest things i saw in you code was improvements . you have improved alot and  trust me . 
    now i know you understand what you are doing . but 
    there is something about how you guys comment a function
    and where you choose to place your single line comments.
    in all you did well.

Ephraim:
    is now a an advance pythonista . he builds things with his python but i also have problem with your codebase .
    you do not need alot  , but just this much . commenting your code really well and even arrangement of the code matters.
    in all well done.

Sandra: 
    i had a simple question about your all your codebase.
    did you write those code yourself . Or someone assisted you .Be it a person or ai. I noticed a slight change in how you write you codes in class and the one that was in the  codebase. If you did it yourself. This is awesome.
     i am even surprise cos it means you are also learning ahead i also have problem with your commenting and the arrangement of your codes. 
     it runs but  they are so piled together .
     in all well done .


the rest:
    yet to receive your push .
    except Mase and Duncan what really really happened.
