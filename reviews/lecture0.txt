this is the reviews for this those who submit their code .

Hackman: we dont assign variable to unknown type in python 
you did name = hackman but hackman was not know . 
please pay attention to types when creating variables.

Mase: Your code is too small for me to give you a review and over
the weekends i did not see any updates.

OdoNti: I noticed your commenting do not reflex what you actually did
.so you give  a comment removing white spaces but you are using title().
you are the only one who pratice in the folder and that is  a plus
you do not like spacing things . please add that to your coding.
for instance print(name, "this is the name") not  print(name,"this is the name")
make your code one effective and then human readable too. 
I also noticed you create so many unwanted variables.

Ephraim : now you had so many comment that were related so why did you 
not just made it all in one comment using multi commenting or doc strings.
just becos the F-string works nobody use that you dont want to cause 
confusion when it not really needed.

Newton: your comments are not reflecting what you did
