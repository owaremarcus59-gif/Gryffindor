Newton : 
 check_out function , variable had wierd names .
 use variable names that are self explanatory.
 now in the function you wanted to avoid the else 
 satement but for that to work . you need to use return  in functions not print.

in your days_of_the_week function
 Lexicographical order arranges strings or sequences based on alphabetical (or numerical) order, similar to a dictionary. A sequence is less than (
) another if, at the first differing position, its element comes earlier in the alphabet (e.g., "apple" 
 "apply"). It is greater than (
) if the element comes later.

 +2 arrangement of the operators matters very well .
 your function is not making sense for instance what is the use of i = 0 variable.


 now in your function_practice.py you worked on functions and scopes and that is very nice work.
 well done.

 General you coding syntaxing improving keep practicing.

 Ephraim : on your assigment function , you tried to use functional programming which you did well .

 you separation logics was spot on but you use blunt variable naming,improper commenting.
 indentation matters and the adv's function was meant to keep asking the questions right but i notice the if statement was asked outside the while loop indentation.

 you coding syntax is advancing at alarming rate and i love it . but be mindful of simple errors which can be avoided. 
i will advice you to always do refactors after your codes works. try to do it in a beter way . or fewer lines .
python gives you that ability.
